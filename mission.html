  <!--     <h1> The Ten-Year Project </h1> -->
      <p>

        The Ten-Year Project, founded in early December of 2019, seeks to empower the youth to explore the world around them and manifest the potential within.

      <p>

    At any moment, we are all presented with a unique opportunity: the freedom to live a life with substance. And yet we continue to traverse ordinary lives – the stories of which would never endure.
        </p>

        <p>
    All too often we let the fear of the unknown stop us. Pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones and trying new things not only helps us to vanquish those fears, but also allows us to expand our minds, broaden our horizons, and grow as individuals.
        </p>

        <p>

    As Aristotle once said, "There is a difference between the pleasures of the moment and the satisfaction that comes from constantly developing and living one’s life to the fullest."
        </p>

        <p>

    Every decision we make over the course of our life sets us up for a million new possibilities. Every day we have the chance to write our life story.
        </p>

        <p>
    We need to ask ourselves, “Who do we want to be in ten years?” and then, take the steps necessary to become that person.
