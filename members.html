              Every interest I have picked up has taught me something different
              about the world. For me, this project is about exploration, to view
              the same horizon with different spyglasses. I believe that the
              simple act of obtaining perspectives builds one's character. So, as
              I journey through these ten years, I hope that I will slowly
              recognize who I am and who I want to be.

              For me, this project is about living a life that feels purposeful;
              it is about being ambitious, making mistakes, and continuing to
              learn about myself, others, and the world around me.

              Life is about creating yourself. Without challenging yourself,
              facing your fears, and opening your mind to new possibilities, you
              can never live up to your true potential. For me, this project is
              about trying new things, fulfilling my dreams, and learning to be
              brave, in order to be the best version of myself and give back as
              much as I can to the world. It’s about seizing every opportunity
              that comes my way – to add the little extra needed to make life
              extraordinary. It’s about living a life worth writing about, so the
              world may keep our stories.

              There's this one thing that we all have. It's free, but priceless.
              We can't keep it, but we can spend it. Once we've lost it, we can
              never get it back. It's also the meaning of my name in Hindi.

              <b>Time</b> is our most valuable asset. Throughout these ten years,
              I look forward to cherishing every moment — and recognizing the
              value of time. Life is long, as long as it is well lived. This is
              our time to make every moment count.

              Why spend 10 years like this?–That’s a great question that I’m sure
              I’ll find many answers to along the way! The nature and people and
              cultures and places of the world call out a million ‘whys’ as I set
              my goals for the next decade. I’m excited for what’s to come and I
              hope to share as much of it as possible.

              For me, this project is about building a virtuous, happy life that
              allows me to become who I want to be. I want to spend the next ten
              years exploring my potentials with the challenges and opportunities
              ahead. By practicing such a lifestyle, I hope to learn a lot so that
              I can share my experiences in finding the purpose of life with
              others.

              I believe that living a fulfilling life involves surprises. It would
              be simple to just exist in college, get an average job and live my
              life. However to surprise yourself with what you can do is what I
              believe gives you true happiness. To live such a life, I must take
              risks, test my limits, and constantly search for betterment. This is
              why I am excited for this project. I will be inspired by everyone
              around me and we will become better together.
